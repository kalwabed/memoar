# Memoar

Trying to solve a problem that doesn't even exist. An experimental project.
You can think of it as a mini blog, for now. You can write your own articles.

## Demo

// Coming very soon.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Vue, Nuxt 3, UnoCSS, TypeScript.

**Server:** Supabase.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

First, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalwabed/memoar.git
```

Then, install dependencies and fetch data to your local machine. **Note that we use PNPM.**

```bash
cd memoar
pnpm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the environment variables from your Supabase project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **(optional)** Setup your own Supabase local development to develop locally. For more information, visit [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development). Or, you can use your own Supabase project.

Finally, run the development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
